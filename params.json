Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. Storm is <a href=\"http://storm-project.net/about/simple-api.html\">simple</a>, can be used with <a href=\"http://storm-project.net/about/multi-language.html\">any programming language</a>, and is a lot of fun to use!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStorm has many use cases: realtime analytics, online machine learning, continuous computation, distributed RPC, ETL, and more. Storm is fast: a benchmark clocked it at over <strong>a million tuples processed per second per node</strong>. It is <a href=\"http://storm-project.net/about/scalable.html\">scalable</a>, <a href=\"http://storm-project.net/about/fault-tolerant.html\">fault-tolerant</a>, <a href=\"http://storm-project.net/about/guarantees-data-processing.html\">guarantees your data will be processed</a>, and is <a href=\"http://storm-project.net/about/deployment.html\">easy to set up and operate</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n  <img src=\"http://storm-project.net/images/topology.png\" style=\"height: 220px;\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStorm <a href=\"http://storm-project.net/about/integrates.html\">integrates</a> with the queueing and database technologies you already use. A Storm topology consumes streams of data and processes those streams in arbitrarily complex ways, repartitioning the streams between each stage of the computation however needed.
